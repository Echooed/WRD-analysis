### WRD-analysis
This Exploratory Data Analysis project with emphasis on data gathering, data wrangling(assessing data for quality and tidiness issue), data cleaning and storing.
I will be analyzing a twitter account(WeRateDog) archive provided by Udacity for its students as part of the fulfillment for Data analytics Nanodegree program.
WeRateDog according to the Founder Matt Nelson “is a social community that celebrate good dogs(they all good dogs) by sharing their stories, improving their lives, and helping the ones who need us most.”
The WeRateDog community has social media presence on both Facebook and Twitter where dogs pictures or videos are displayed with captivating stories (could be humorous or emotional) and a unique rating scale usually a 10 denominator and a numerator greater than 10, with a max rating scale of 15/10.
